# EigenCAM for YOLOv5

EigenCAM is a gradient-free visualization technique used to understand and interpret deep learning models' decisions, particularly in object detection. This repository demonstrates the integration of EigenCAM with YOLOv5 to provide visual explanations of object detection results.

## Features
- Visualize the regions of an image that contribute most to YOLOv5 predictions.
- Generate class activation maps using EigenCAM.
- Easily integrate the provided code with other YOLOv5-based projects.
